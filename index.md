### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, Part 2 was one if my favorite labs. This lab taught me how linting worked, which is an important way to check if the code is going to be formatted correctly. It taught me a way for me to start learning how to correctly format my code to make it easier to read and etc.

    * Lab 3
    Lab 3, Part 1 was another of my favorite labs that I worked on over this semester. This lab focused in a mad lib type of activity. Where I had to find a way for me to correctly format the answers inputted by the user when the code ran. It also introduced me to start using std::cin to take the input of the user. And use std::cout to display that information back after the code runs.

    * Lab 4

    Lab 4, Part 1 was my final lab that I also enjoyed working on. It introduced how to start using subtraction adding different values together. I got to learn how to successfully format and use different integers to create new sums. These new sums would then be used to cout to learn how to create complex print statements.
